Patino nailed, the first yellow of the game to them. \u00a0Booked my Mr.Bond who looks like a grey-haired former Mod! The resulting free kicking played into the box by Dougall, broke to Thorniley on the edge, floated into Madine and back post but pokes it over the bar when free, karate kick stretching. Cov hit the post, the ball in from the right, and Charlie Allen hit the post. \u00a0Did Maxi get a toe on it? Evoesque diag from Connolly finds Carey on the left. \u00a0Beautiful first touch, dummies defender and drills the base of the post GOAL - Palmer megs Jud to put Cov ahead, great build-up to the goal. DIASSLOWED GOAL - CJ judged offside after Madine header goalbound. \u00a0Did he touch it? GOAL! \u00a0Madine intercepts the backpass, sets up Hubby's cross and a glancing header Connolly blazes over after great move and cross from Patino Two more Cov chances, close GOAL! \u00a0Yates header! \u00a07 in 5 and top scorer in the league. \u00a0A great cross from CJ, Madine-esque header.SUPPORT--------------If you would like to help support our show and help us pay for software, hosting, equipment, etc, please consider joining our Patreon supporter program.In return, you'll get extra content, early releases, access to our private Patreon WhatsApp chat group and the odd giveaway now and then. \u00a0To find out more go to:https://www.patreon.com/seasiderspodFOLLOW-------------You can follow us on the following platforms:YOUTUBEhttps://www.youtube.com/@seasiderspodTWITTERhttps://twitter.com/seasiderspodWEBSITEhttps://www.seasiderspodcast.co.uk/FACEBOOKhttps://www.facebook.com/seasiderspodPODCASTS APPhttps://podfollow.com/seasiders-podcast Hosted on Acast.

So you finished in 21st place in League two on 38 points, I guess you\u2019ve had better seasons? You dropped out of the league after the 07-08 season and spent SIX seasons in the conference eventually returning to the football league after winning the title in 2012-13. \u00a0What was it like playing in the conference and how tough a league is it to get out of? Notable ex players who\u2019ve played for both include Gordon Owen, Neal Bishop and the most well known is probably Alex Baptiste. Baps played for you between 2002-2008 with 198 appearances in all competitions, so, is he a bit of a club legend considering he was also a local boy done-good, all the way to the Premier League?Blackpool have signed winger CJ Hamilton from Mansfield Town on a three-year deal for an undisclosed fee.The 25-year-old scored three goals in 41 games for the Stags in all competitions last season.He began his career at Sheffield United but left without playing a game and joined Mansfield in 2016 before going on to make 173 appearances.--- What was your initial reaction when you first found out he had been sold? Could you elaborate on his best position and what can we expect from him? How integral was he to your squad and how much will he be missed? Will you be sad to see him go? What is his temperament like? How do you think he\u2019ll fit in under Neil Critchley's system at Blackpool playing \u2018The Liverpool way\u2019? How do you think he will get on at Blackpool? Do you think he has the potential to play at the higher grade? Hosted on Acast. See acast.com/privacy for more information.",
