			<title><![CDATA[Blackpool 4 - Nottingham Forest 1 : REACTION]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>It’s Sunday 8th January 2023, in this evening's show, we purr over a giant-killing FA Cup performance yesterday as the ‘Pool destroyed the Florists to make it into the bag for the fourth-round draw. &nbsp;We’ll also be discussing the tremendous news that Josh Bowler has rejoined the club on loan till the end of the season and the signing of Morgan Rogers.</p>
<p>#blackpoolfc #nottsforest</p>
<p><strong>SEASIDE SEVEN</strong></p>
<ol>
 <li>Andy Lyons makes his debut.. Thoughts on the new boy and the starting eleven.</li>
 <li>Marv is back in the goals and back on form. &nbsp;Cause of this?</li>
 <li>Poveda power - Has the real Poveda, finally stood up? Brilliant performance and goal.</li>
 <li>Subs spot on and the impact of Jezza.</li>
  <li>Excellent performance, goal and the renaissance of CJ.</li>
  <li>A hat trick (of misses) for Sturridge.</li>
  <li>Appleton's tangerine army chanted (very faint). &nbsp;Fickle or what?! &nbsp;Steve Cooper not giving one ounce of credit to Blackpool in a post-match interview.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>EXTRA TIME</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>VAR - In some cup ties and not in others, what a mess! &nbsp;Thoughts on this.</li>
  <li>The sparse home crowd. &nbsp;Why? &nbsp;The third round of the FA used to be one of the most special games in the football calendar.</li>
  <li>New signings Morgan Rogers and of course Josh Bowler re-resigning. What else do we need in the squad to stay up, if anything?</li>

			<title><![CDATA[Blackpool 1 - Sunderland : REACTION]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>It’s Sunday 1st January 2023, and in the first pod of the new year we are discussing the ‘Pool just about getting a point against the high flying Black Cats at Bloomfield Road this afternoon, a result which extends our run without a win to nine games, four points from a possible twenty-seven and see’s further pressure mount on manager, Michael Appleton.</p>
<p>#blackpoolfc #sunderland</p>
<p><strong>SEASIDE SEVEN</strong></p>
<ol>
 <li><strong>The line up</strong> seems like one big middle finger to the support. Grimmy dropped, Yates left out…</li>
 <li><strong>Good first half</strong>. Fast and incisive football. Put pressure on and maintained it for spells. Best we've played since when? (Is Poveda the greatest player on earth?). &nbsp;Lavery composed finish and cool through ball from CJ.</li>
 <li><strong>Sunderland second half switch - </strong>Did they go to 3 at the back and put extra in middle</li>
 <li><strong>Sloppy seconds</strong> - For the second game running, sloppy misplaced passes throughout the match. &nbsp;Whats the cause of this? &nbsp;Players or coaching?</li>
  <li><strong>Sunderland onslaught</strong> - How many chances did Sunderland have. Hit bar twice, mad scramble that somehow stayed out. Marv as goalie almost twice…</li>
  <li><strong>Tailors dummy</strong> - Second half totally overrun in midfield, Appleton just stood there watching it happen, did nothing to affect change. &nbsp;Does he watch the same game as us? Why not stiffen midfield?</li>
  <li><strong>Booooo</strong> Appleton or ref booed? Seemed to be laughing when the booing started but I thought it aimed at ref.</li>

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;It’s Sunday 1st January 2023, and in the first pod of the new year we are discussing the ‘Pool just about getting a point against the high flying Black Cats at Bloomfield Road this afternoon, a result which extends our run without a win to nine games, four points from a possible twenty-seven and see’s further pressure mount on manager, Michael Appleton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#blackpoolfc #sunderland&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SEASIDE SEVEN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The line up&lt;/strong&gt; seems like one big middle finger to the support. Grimmy dropped, Yates left out…&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good first half&lt;/strong&gt;. Fast and incisive football. Put pressure on and maintained it for spells. Best we&apos;ve played since when? (Is Poveda the greatest player on earth?). &amp;nbsp;Lavery composed finish and cool through ball from CJ.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sunderland second half switch - &lt;/strong&gt;Did they go to 3 at the back and put extra in middle&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sloppy seconds&lt;/strong&gt; - For the second game running, sloppy misplaced passes throughout the match. &amp;nbsp;Whats the cause of this? &amp;nbsp;Players or coaching?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sunderland onslaught&lt;/strong&gt; - How many chances did Sunderland have. Hit bar twice, mad scramble that somehow stayed out. Marv as goalie almost twice…&lt;/li&gt;

			<title><![CDATA[Blackpool 1 - Sheffield United 2 : REACTION]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>It’s Friday 30th December 2022, and in this final pod of the year, we discuss the future of Michael Appelton and our potential for Championship survival as ‘Pool as we narrowly lost to Sheffield United in front of the Sky Cameras at Bloomfield Road last night.</p>
<p>#blackpoolfc #sheffutd</p>
<p><strong>PRE MATCH</strong></p>
<ol>
 <li>Two one all draws away at Cardiff and Hull since last pod</li>
 <li>The winless run stretched to eight games after today, although unbeaten in three</li>
 <li>Three points out of a possible twenty-four thus far</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>SEASIDE SEVEN</strong></p>
<ol>
 <li><strong>Good first ten </strong>- Couple of good half chances, Poveda hits the bar on six minutes and a positive start to the game.</li>
  <li><strong>Shite second ten </strong>&nbsp;- Sheff United then on top and Sandje Berge all the time in the world to pick his spot after good work form Ndiaye. &nbsp;Carey at fault for not getting across his man?</li>
  <li><strong>Switch</strong> - Beesley and Yates switched from left to right on around 30 minutes. &nbsp;What was MA trying to achieve? &nbsp;Bogle getting in the down the right all the time maybe having something to do with it?</li>
  <li><strong>Sloppy</strong> - in possession and giving the ball away easily on numerous occasions. &nbsp;Thompson is particularly poor in his distribution, Madine gets frustrated with his service over his head all the time</li>
  <li><strong>Tommo’s Christmas present </strong>- McAtee runs length off pitch after Carey slips, unchallenged to pass the ball home. &nbsp;Thompson not coming across to meet the man was criminal</li>
  <li><strong>Back in it</strong> - Big Gaz brilliantly headed a corner back across the box, Spud couldn't miss. &nbsp;Did we look more dangerous going direct?</li>
  <li><strong>Second half improvement </strong>- was a better performance and maybe deserved a point but had Sheff U taken their foot off the gas?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>POST MATCH</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Clappleton not going over to away fans-gate. &nbsp;Damned if he does, damned if he doesn't?</li>
  <li>Sunderland at home next on NYD</li>
  <li>Appleton back or sack?</li>
</ol>

			<title><![CDATA[Blackpool 0 - Birmingham City 0 : REACTION]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>It’s Sunday the 11th of December 2022, in this evening’s first pod for a while, we discuss yesterday's dreary nil-nil draw as ‘Pool returned to Championship action at a baltic Bloomfield Road where we witnessed a performance that did little to warm the hearts of the hardy souls who braved the almost sub-zero terraces and stands.</p>
<p>#blackpoolfc #birminghamcity</p>
<p><strong>SEASIDE SEVEN</strong></p>
<ol>
 <li><strong>No Grimmy</strong>, again</li>
 <li><strong>Lucky to not be behind</strong>, two or three down by halftime</li>
  <li><strong>Second half worse than the first?</strong></li>
  <li>Are we '<strong>just stuck with him'</strong> or not? Should we stick or twist? If you were given his job tomorrow - how would you change it?</li>
  <li><strong>Flat as a pancake</strong> - Deadest atmosphere at Bloomfield Rd in recent times. Nothing at the end of the match</li>
  <li><strong>Williams improving?</strong> - Is Williams actually not quite as shit as we thought.</li>
  <li><strong>A good point?</strong> Did a 0-0 draw with no shots on target exceed our expectations and does that say a lot about where we are?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>OTHER STUFF</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Critchley is confirmed as new QPR manager, head coach, or whatever. &nbsp;Thoughts?</li>
  <li>FA Cup round three draw, home to Notts Forrest</li>
  <li>Recruitment team changes, is this an admission of failure? &nbsp;Chris Badlam will manage the sporting and performance departments at the Club, including the support staff around the First-Team, Development Squad and Academy.</li>
  <li>Club and Trust opening up the club as a winter warm up hub</li>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>It's Wednesday 16th November 2022, in this evening’s show we are discussing the future of Michael Appleton as the ‘Pool crashed to their fourth defeat on the bounce against lowly and managerless Wigan at the DW Stadium last Saturday, as we go into the Word Cup break in the relegation zone</p>
<p><strong>SEASIDE SEVEN</strong></p>
<ol>
 <li><strong>The turnout &nbsp;</strong>- Around 3,500 fans in attendance, great support although deafened by the loudest ever PA system known to man. &nbsp;And the last post - was weirdly applauded and also disrespected by some fans</li>
 <li><strong>The goalkeeper </strong>&nbsp;- Maxwell keeps the shirt, what has Grimmy done to not get a look in given Maxwell's indifferent form? &nbsp;Spoke to Grimmy in Costa. Three changes for the Seasiders fixture against Connolly, Williams and Lavery all start</li>
  <li><strong>Marv was sent off again </strong>- Terrible decision-making yet again, sent off and is regressing badly this season<strong>, </strong>a liability almost. &nbsp;Does anyone care to speculate the reasons why? &nbsp;And was it a pen?</li>
  <li><strong>Big Gaz Boom!</strong> &nbsp;- &nbsp;Dragged one wide early doors but what a strike from Madine, hunger, desire and great technical ability.</li>
  <li><strong>Corner fiasco </strong>&nbsp;- Never a corner in the first place but laughable defending. &nbsp;No one marking either post. Who’s to blame for that?</li>
  <li><strong>On Tilt</strong> to score the winner. With the constant barrage of balls into the box in the second half, no surprise Wigan eventually put one in.</li>
  <li><strong>Sacked in the morning </strong>- Our responses to hearing that</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>TALKING POINT</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Post-match policing operation in Wigan. &nbsp;Blackpool fans were batoned and assaulted by GMP on the walk back to the train station.</li>

			<title><![CDATA[Blackpool 0 - Middlesbrough 3 : REACTION]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>It's Wednesday 9th November 2022, in this evening show we are both previewing this Saturday's away fixture at Wigan, and if we must, go over the debacle against Middlesborough at Bloomfield Road last night as the ‘Pool put in a turgid performance against the Teessiders.</p>
<p><strong>SEASIDE SEVEN</strong></p>
<ul>
 <li><strong>Decision making</strong>
 <ul>
      <li>Theo dragging a shot at the near post when HAS to go far after well worked set piece corner</li>
      <li>Maxwell not coming for the cross for their goal, Ward not picking up their 21 to head back and Jones was unmarked getting the run on Thompson to score</li>
      <li>Bad decision-making by the players, bad coaching or just bad players?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Boro pen?</strong> Corbs and Thompson are both skinned by Jones on the left, Thompson bringing his man down, lucky no pen.</li>
  <li><strong>Dracula</strong> - 26 Lehman header, Maxwell static on his line again allowing a free glancing header from the corner, should have scored. &nbsp;What is the keeper solution?</li>
  <li><strong>Comedy of errors</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Ward drills a hospital ball into Marv</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
<ul>
  <li>Marv's terrible control loses the ball and Forss gets a run on goal
    <ul>
      <li>Never a pen, dive by Forss and knocks pen it but all of our own making.</li>
      <li>Who’s to blame for incidents like this which are becoming a regular occurrence?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Jezza shanks</strong> -
    <ul>
      <li>Nearly an OG but was in the right-back position at the time. &nbsp;Is this Jezza clearly not trusting Ward who was static at the time?</li>
      <li>Pulls wide our only real chance of the game</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>The right stuff</strong> - Ball played out to the right again, Ward nowhere and easy as you like, unmarked Akmom finishes. &nbsp;I wonder if SS still maintains that Grant Ward can play right back?</li>
  <li><strong>Walkout!</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Can you blame anyone for walking out early?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>TALKING POINTS</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>How do we get out of this rut?</li>
  <li>Who’s to blame for the current situation?</li>
  <li>Do you think we’ll stay up?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>WIGAN INTERVIEW</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Play VT
    <ul>
      <li>Tell us about the financial state of Wigan at the moment and do you think the administration is a possibility given the late players' wages again?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Curtis Tilt?</li>
  <li>Where do you think you’ll finish this season?</li>
  <li>Pick team</li>
  <li>Prediction</li>

			<title><![CDATA[Coventry City 1 - Blackpool 2 : REACTION]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>It's Sunday 30th October 2022, and in this evening's show, we will be purring over a Gary Goals-inspired victory which saw “a team like Blackpool” overturn a half-time deficit to come away with all three points at the Coventry Building Society Arena.</p>
<p>#coventrycity #blackpoolfc</p>
<p><strong>Welcome Kev &amp; Pete</strong></p>
<p>Kev Owers &amp; Pete Dixon</p>
<p><strong>Talking points</strong></p>
<ul>
 <li>M6 a nightmare on the journey there but made it thanks to Siri and Jimmy Hill way</li>
 <li>Unseasonable warmth, twenty degrees C</li>
  <li>Great start, Carey slotting Madine in, should have scored but great timing over the run. &nbsp;Tried to dink the GK.</li>
  <li>Patino nailed, the first yellow of the game to them. &nbsp;Booked my Mr.Bond who looks like a grey-haired former Mod!</li>
  <li>The resulting free kicking played into the box by Dougall, broke to Thorniley on the edge, floated into Madine and back post but pokes it over the bar when free, karate kick stretching.</li>
  <li>Cov hit the post, the ball in from the right, and Charlie Allen hit the post. &nbsp;Did Maxi get a toe on it?</li>
  <li>Evoesque diag from Connolly finds Carey on the left. &nbsp;Beautiful first touch, dummies defender and drills the base of the post</li>
  <li>GOAL - Palmer megs Jud to put Cov ahead, great build-up to the goal.</li>
  <li>DIASSLOWED GOAL - CJ judged offside after Madine header goalbound. &nbsp;Did he touch it?</li>
  <li>GOAL! &nbsp;Madine intercepts the backpass, sets up Hubby's cross and a glancing header</li>
  <li>Connolly blazes over after great move and cross from Patino</li>
  <li>Two more Cov chances, close</li>
  <li>GOAL! &nbsp;Yates header! &nbsp;7 in 5 and top scorer in the league. &nbsp;A great cross from CJ, Madine-esque header.</li>
</ul>

			<title><![CDATA[Blackpool 4 - PNE 2 : REACTION]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>It's Sunday 23rd of October. In this evening's show, we review the pulsating West Lancs derby at Bloomfield Road yesterday, as a clinical 'Pool despatched their arch-rivals from down the M55 in a glorious afternoon for all in tangerine and white!</p>
<ul>
 <li>PNE have conceded over 36% of their season goals to Blackpool</li>
 <li>Up to 18th on 19th points. &nbsp;Three points behind the Nobbers with a game in hand. &nbsp;Last five games, won 2, drew 2, lost 1.</li>
  <li>PNe players to impress - Lindsay centre half. Storey right back. &nbsp;Whiteman centre mid. &nbsp;Woodburn was handy in the ten.</li>
  <li>For once, ‘Pool were deadly in front of goal which has been a criticism throughout the season. &nbsp;What a time to turn things around in that department!</li>
  <li>Big up to the referee, Chris Kavanah. Outstanding performance in a frantic local derby.</li>
  <li>Atmosphere - absolutely throughout</li>
  <li>Policing operation afterwards, horses on Bloomfield Road</li>

			<title><![CDATA[Blackpool v PNE : PREVIEW]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>It's Thursday 20th October 2022, in this evening's special West Lancs derby day preview, we are once again joined by our chum from down the M55, Tom Harrison who will be helping us build-up to Saturday's much anticipated “Battle of Bloomfield Road”.</p>
<p><strong>PNE</strong></p>
<ul>
 <li>So Tom
 <ul>
      <li>P16 W5 D7 L4 GF9 GA10</li>
      <li>9th on 22points and two points off the playoffs.</li>
      <li>On paper, a good start to the season - give us your thoughts.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>You’ve currently got the best away record in the division, do you think that will be a factor in tomorrow's game?</li>
  <li>Conversely, you're in the bottom three for home form, only recording one victory at Deepdale all season. &nbsp;What do you put this down to?</li>
  <li>Does it bother you barely see any goals or entertainment as long as you are picking up results?</li>
  <li>What do you and other PNE fans think of HaalandWatch?</li>
  <li>Tell us about the form players in Preston's team and players we should watch out for. &nbsp;Riis, Parrott and Greg Cunnigham are all hitting form I believe?</li>
  <li>Any injuries?</li>
  <li>Has Ben Woodburn turned out to be as shite as we all said he would be?</li>
  <li>Onto the day itself, what are your plans?</li>
  <li>The police operation is blocking off large swathes of roads usually used by Blackpool fans, including Bloomfield Road. &nbsp;The police at Preston rightly kept ‘Pool fans behind at Deepdale for nearly an hour. &nbsp;What is the police's obsession with forcing all fans out at the same time?</li>
  <li>The ticket situation has again reared its head again - what do you think of your allocation no doubt it will be reciprocated at Deepdale.</li>
  <li>iFollow</li>
  <li>Finally, match predictions</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Team picker</strong></p>
<p>Our team to beat the Nobbers</p>
<p><strong>Hull Reaction</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Thoughts on the match</li>

			<title><![CDATA[The Battle of Bramall Lane]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>It's Sunday 16th October 2022, in this evening's show, we discuss four red cards, six goals, a two-goal deficit overturned, a missed penalty, a mass brawl and a referee as bent as a Uri Geller spoon!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sheffield United 3 - Blackpool 3&nbsp;</p>
<p>#sheffutd #blackpoolfc</p>
<ul>
 <li>Madine not taking a knee! Thoughts?</li>
 <li>Away kit with tangerine socks, looked awesome imo!</li>
  <li>Great start but two down after twenty minutes - a common pattern this season - why?</li>
  <li>A brace of braces for Jezza, what caused the upturn in form?</li>
  <li>Brilliant performance from Lavery, discuss.</li>
  <li>Dougall puts us three two up with a sliding finish</li>
  <li>Bridcutt head injury, gets ignored by the twat that is David Webb</li>
  <li>Marv red, silly challenge really. &nbsp;Thorniley was covering</li>
  <li>Thomspn red after a dual assault into boards from their lad. &nbsp;Petulant kick of the ball, but worthy of a red, really?</li>
  <li>Williams and CJ on</li>
  <li>Disallowed Sheff U goal for offside and missed two sitters, one from Bash</li>
  <li>Their laughable penalty and miss. &nbsp;David Webb must have the Blades on his acca!</li>
  <li>Connolly handball</li>
  <li>8 mins of injury time, two incredible saves from Maxi in the period</li>
  <li>McBurney nails Maxwell, three of their players then obscure Maxi in offside positions and Norwood smashes it home. &nbsp;Heartbreak.</li>
  <li>CJ nearly winning it for ‘Pool at the death</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Post-match</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Appleton clearly not happy with the officials, great to see him wading in and to quote MCLF “The body warmer twat would have run a mile.”</li>
  <li>Lavery being sent off for being body slammed by Fodderimgham</li>
  <li>Lavery three-game game ban, misses nob end. &nbsp;Thompson and Marv, one game ban</li>
  <li>Stewards kicking off with fans - what happened?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Media reaction</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Laughable EFL highlights show not even discussing the referee's performance</li>
  <li>Michael Dawson on SSN saying Webb got everything correct and did a good job</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Hull Preview/News</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Pick the team for the match out of the scraps of a squad!</li>
  <li>Tangerine team mates</li>
</ul>

<ul>
 <li>Travel nightmares getting there</li>

<p><strong>Talking points…</strong></p>
<p>- Line up and strange formation</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Blackpool 0 - Swansea 1 : REACTION]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Match talking points:</p>
<p>- First half, game poor,</p>
<p>Is Swansea the better side?</p>
<p>Playing out from the back not working?</p>
<p>Wasteful in possession</p>
<p>Bowler chance</p>
<p>Ben Cabango header</p>
<p>Marvs tackle</p>
<p>The second half, was much improved - Lavery the catalyst?</p>
<p>(Grimmy save in front of the north from deflection - outstanding)</p>
<p>Jerry pen - unlucky? Hit quite well, struck keeper’s foot… (first pen Jerry ever missed (outside of shootouts))</p>
<p>Bowlers attempt straight at the keeper</p>
<p>Josh Bowler’s failure to square to Jerry</p>
<p>Was the draw the more fair result? - Despite the result, the best performance of the season?</p>
<p>Lack of goals is the issue (is that supply or finishing?)</p>
<p>Things getting toxic, fans with short memories?</p>
<p>Appleton: fighting a losing battle with some fans?</p>
<p>Transfer window: what’s needed, what we’ll likely get (might link better to fan reaction bit as will probably get tweets like ‘we need 11 new players)</p>
<p>Twitter Fans’ Reactions</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Pyros, Prices, Swansea & Barrow]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this evening’s late-night preview show, we are taking a look at Saturday's fixture against the Swans and also looking back on the shit show against Barrow as the ‘Pool were dumped out of the Carabao Cup at the first hurdle. Also looking at the latest news and developments from Bloomfield Road.</p>
<p><strong>Topics</strong></p>
<ul>
 <li>Barrow in the Carabao Cup</li>
 <li>None of our kids in starting line up?</li>
  <li>First half woeful</li>
  <li>Lavery unlucky or not good enough?</li>
  <li>Dare we speak of CJ again…?</li>
  <li>Ratings or just quick MOM/villain of the match? (Patino not mom!)</li>
  <li>Ticket prices for Burnley away</li>
  <li>Club response (see Sean's article - basically, no parachute money,competing with big clubs and official coaches are cheap)</li>
  <li>Obviously looking to cash in our status as preferred away day. Is away travel going to be in jeopardy as fuel prices and energy prices create cashflow concerns for many? Where does this leave our model?</li>
  <li>Whilst sympathetic to the difficulty of the club competing and wifet rising costs (the club has energy bill too for example) should we not be pressing for reasonable pricing across all football? Which includes our own club… is the bigger picture what counts?</li>
  <li>Keogh has gone to Ipswich.</li>
  <li>Is it good business and a natural end of a great but ultimately aging player or could we have got a year out of him?</li>
  <li>Is it a sign of the manager building *his* dressing room by being keen to move on a major personality in Critch's team?</li>
  <li>Fave Keogh moment/general Keogh appreciation (he deserves it)</li>
  <li>What does this mean for the defence?</li>
  <li>Swansea at home preview</li>
  <li>Previous games (obvs 6-3 but what else?)</li>
  <li>Swan and a Seasider (played for both)</li>
  <li>Will it be as boring as previous Critch v Russell Martin games?</li>
  <li>Sean explains to us stuff that only he knows about Swansea.</li>

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;In this evening’s late-night preview show, we are taking a look at Saturday&apos;s fixture against the Swans and also looking back on the shit show against Barrow as the ‘Pool were dumped out of the Carabao Cup at the first hurdle. Also looking at the latest news and developments from Bloomfield Road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Topics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Barrow in the Carabao Cup&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;None of our kids in starting line up?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;First half woeful&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lavery unlucky or not good enough?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dare we speak of CJ again…?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ratings or just quick MOM/villain of the match? (Patino not mom!)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ticket prices for Burnley away&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Club response (see Sean&apos;s article - basically, no parachute money,competing with big clubs and official coaches are cheap)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Obviously looking to cash in our status as preferred away day. Is away travel going to be in jeopardy as fuel prices and energy prices create cashflow concerns for many? Where does this leave our model?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Whilst sympathetic to the difficulty of the club competing and wifet rising costs (the club has energy bill too for example) should we not be pressing for reasonable pricing across all football? Which includes our own club… is the bigger picture what counts?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Keogh has gone to Ipswich.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Is it good business and a natural end of a great but ultimately aging player or could we have got a year out of him?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Is it a sign of the manager building *his* dressing room by being keen to move on a major personality in Critch&apos;s team?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fave Keogh moment/general Keogh appreciation (he deserves it)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What does this mean for the defence?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Swansea at home preview&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Previous games (obvs 6-3 but what else?)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Swan and a Seasider (played for both)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Will it be as boring as previous Critch v Russell Martin games?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sean explains to us stuff that only he knows about Swansea.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pick our team&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The great formatiom debate?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Predictions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

			<title><![CDATA[Abandoned by Critch]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>In this special Extraordinary General Podcast (EGP) we are reacting to the bolt out of the blue news, that Neil Critchley has left the building, having made the decision to carry Steven Gerards bags as Aston Villa's assistant manager.</p>
<p><strong>Talking Points</strong></p>
<p>If you’re listening to this, you’ve probably heard the news. Blackpool Football Club have agreed terms with Aston Villa for Neil Critchley to join them (and Steven Gerrard) as their new assistant manager. It follows Michael Beale vacating that post to become QPR Manager.</p>
<ol>
 <li><strong>First off gentleman, how are we feeling?</strong>
 <ul>
      <li>March interview with the Gazette where he said ‘hopefully there are a few more years to come yet”</li>
      <li>Was the connection with the fans a ploy to get us on his side?</li>
      <li>Mitch on Critch</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>It feels like an odd move - to go from an up and coming Championship side to #2 at a mid-table Premier League side. Beale clearly saw the reverse as a step up. Why do we think Neil Critchley has decided to leave the club?</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Is it money for him personally? Better wages?</li>
      <li>Relationship with Gerrard? (The two worked together in LFC’s youth set-up. Gerrard has said he was the “#1 choice” based on their previous work together)</li>
      <li>Is it the supposed lack of transfer budget - dependent on selling Bowler?</li>
      <li>The club is investing off the pitch; so it isn’t like the club is refusing to show ambition.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Does moving in this way tarnish Critchley’s legacy?</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Achievements on the pitch</li>
      <li>Any comparison to Holloway?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>What next for Blackpool football club?</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Presumably we have compensation given Critchley was under contract to 2025</li>
      <li>What should we be looking for in a new manager?</li>
      <li>Who does this panel feel should get the job?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Potential Replacements (ranked by BetVictor favourites)</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Dave Challinor (6/1) - Stockport County</li>
      <li>Michael Appleton (8/1) - just left Lincoln City</li>
      <li>Michael Duff (8/1) - Cheltenham Town</li>
      <li>Leam Richardson (8/1) - Wigan Athletic</li>
      <li>Micky Mellon (10/1) - Tranmere Rovers, formerly Dundee</li>
      <li>Gareth Ainsworth (10/1) - Wycombe Wanderers</li>
      <li>John Coleman (12/1) - Accrington Stanley
        <ol>
          <li>Takes players from non-league, and now able to perform in League One</li>
          <li>Lots of experience - but a bit more traditional</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Tony Mowbray (12/1) - just left Blackburn Rovers</li>
      <li>Jimmy Floyd Hasselbank (12/1) - Burton Albion</li>
      <li>Simon Grayson (12/1) - sacked from Fleetwood</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Other</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Sean Dyche?
    <ul>
      <li>Surely he’ll sit tight and wait for Steve Bruce to be sacked?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Liam Manning from MK Dons?</li>
  <li>Ian Evatt?</li>
  <li>Wayne Rooney?</li>
  <li>Michael Carrick?</li>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>It’s Monday 4th of April 2022 and joining us this evening to help us preview round two of tomorrow’s West Lancashire derby at Deepdale is Tom Harrison, who you may remember joined us before the “big fat boo inducing” performance at Bloomfield Road back in October.</p>
<ul>
 <li><strong>Introduce Tom Harrison</strong></li>
 <li><strong>Ryan Lowe</strong>
 <ul>
     <li>Has the style of football changed and are you happy with it?</li>
      <li>You’ve had some great results and some shocking results under him, what have been the highs and lows (no pun intended)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Press conference today</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Sean to provide insights</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Injury list</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Preston &amp; Blackpool</li>
      <li>Blackpool making late call on Dujon Sterling, Jordan Gabriel trained and may play a part, but only if Sterling can’t make it having missed 5 weeks.</li>
      <li>Keshi, Maxwell and Keogh all 100% fit to play, likely too soon for Garbutt.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>100 anniversary match for Tom Finney</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Just a ruse from Peter Ridsdale to justify the ticket allocation?</li>
      <li>Have the Nobbers been dishing out free tickets?</li>
      <li>What crowd are they expecting?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Stats corner</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Form of both teams</li>
      <li>The lasst double between the two sides was in 72/73 season\</li>
      <li>We concede a lot more open play chances than PNE 39.7 to 29.5 xG</li>
      <li>Both got top quality keepers - Dan Grimshaw 4.1 prevented goals, Daniel Iversen 3.6, Chris Maxwell 3.4.</li>
      <li>Keshi Anderson averages 2 key passes per game, progressive carries average distance 10m, on par with Bowler.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Match Predictions</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Starting Eleven</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>We pick our starting eleven</li>

      &lt;li&gt;Form of both teams&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The lasst double between the two sides was in 72/73 season\&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;We concede a lot more open play chances than PNE 39.7 to 29.5 xG&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Both got top quality keepers - Dan Grimshaw 4.1 prevented goals, Daniel Iversen 3.6, Chris Maxwell 3.4.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Keshi Anderson averages 2 key passes per game, progressive carries average distance 10m, on par with Bowler.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Match Predictions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Starting Eleven&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;We pick our starting eleven&lt;/li&gt;

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Its Sunday 17th October 2021, in today’s show we discuss the disappointing away defeat at the City Ground as the ‘Pool unfortunately end Forest’s run of not winning at home all season, until yesterday!</p>
<p><strong>Seaside seven:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>TJJ - what is he? Why is he starting? Have we seen enough now to say it’s not working for him? Who else? (i.e. Mitchell, Dale etc?)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Injuries - Are we a) signing injury prone players or b) working in such an intense way that we get more injuries or c) both or d) something else i.e. we’ve angered the gods somehow. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Referee - Was he as shit as I thought he was?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maxwell - how much did we miss him setting a tempo and leading? Grimshaw didn’t do much wrong but how much do we need his feet in the backline for he way we play?</p>
<p>Penalty claims. I didn’t think TJJ was one and I have no idea what the other one was but Twitter reckons they were nailed on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shape of team - how much did we miss Anderson? (till Mitchell came on)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Positives: didn't play that well and didn't get hammered, skipper Marvin good again + Yates is back - quality today.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The chat was an immediate reaction to the news of the forming of the "European Super League" and covered its implications for Blackpool, the lower leagues and English football in general. &nbsp;Obviously not relevant now as it's been shit-canned but was a great conversation, nonetheless.&nbsp;</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Oxford United 0 - Blackpool 2 : "Oxford jabbed"]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>It’s Saturday the 20th March 2021. &nbsp;In today's post match pod we are joined by Oxford fan Adam Strand who’s going to help us analyse Blackpool’s FOURTH away win on the bounce, this time, a fine two-nil win at the Kassam Stadium.</p>
<p><strong>First Half</strong></p>
<ul>
 <li>Hectic start to the match, with ‘Pool pressing from the off, for once!<br>
</li>
 <li>5 - KK long range shot<br>
</li>
  <li>7 - Tricky Brandon Barker run past Turton, crosses into Maxwell chest.<br>
</li>
  <li>9 - Dougal blazes over<br>
</li>
  <li>14 - Great bending corner from KK, headed off line from Ballard header. &nbsp;Sykes clears off the line.<br>
</li>
  <li>15 - GOAL! &nbsp;Dougal. &nbsp;Corner from Garbutt, cleared, headed back in from KK, on by Thorniley and finished by Dougal.<br>
</li>
  <li>20 - Another dangerous Barker run down the left, caused havoc in Blackpool box. &nbsp;Ex Rangers man looks a threat.<br>
</li>
  <li>Great high pressing from Bllackpool in first half of first half<br>
</li>
  <li>27 - Mark Sykes drills a great shot just wide.<br>
</li>
  <li>30 - Ward ‘cross/shot’ goes out for a throw in from great counter attack<br>
</li>
  <li>35 - Gorrins misplaced pass, KK intercepts and curls it just wide. &nbsp;Should have hit the target<br>
</li>
  <li>42 - GOAL! &nbsp;Ballard. &nbsp;Another beautiful inswinging KK corner, powered in by Ballard.<br>
</li>
  <li>Best half of the season by Blackpool that. &nbsp;Letting Oxford defence have the ball then high pressing their midfield and refusing to let them play making them go long.<br>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Second Half</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>46 - ‘Pool counter, KK cross caused havoc, Atkinson keeps ball off the line by falling on the ball<br>
</li>
  <li>47 - Ox then counter with Shadipo firing straight at Maxwell - should have done better as it opened up for him<br>
</li>
  <li>55 - Shadipo great chance. &nbsp;4 v 2 break and should have scored. &nbsp;Great block from Garbutt.<br>
</li>
  <li>57 - Embleton drags one just wide after good work on the right, lacking in power though<br>
</li>
  <li>59 - KK slotted in from Yates, KK dinks but Stevens saves after quickly coming off his line<br>
</li>
  <li>70 - Embleton 1-2 with Yates, Stevens tips over, great save<br>
</li>
  <li>75 - Ageyi drills shot in, straight at Maxwell. &nbsp;Oxford pressing now and looking dangerous.<br>
</li>
  <li>80 - Barkers dangerous clipped cross from the by-line, headed wide by Agi.<br>
</li>
  <li>82 - Gabriel played in at angle, shot tipped round from Stevens for a corner.<br>
</li>
  <li>‘Pool in control of the match last ten minutes of the match, keeping the ball in their half<br>
</li>
  <li>88 - Gabriel bursts into box put pokes it over with his right foot. &nbsp;Should have taken it on his left maybe.<br>
</li>
  <li>SIX minutes of added time?!!!<br>
</li>
</ul>

			<title><![CDATA[Preview : Oxford United (h) with Steve Day]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[It’s Friday 11th December 2020, on tonights show we are joined by Steve Day, a lifelong Oxford fan who will be giving us some insight into their season so far, where its all going wrong for the pre-season promotion favourites and how expects the teams to fair tomorrow.
We’ll also be going over previous matches between the two clubs, players who've played for both and making our match predictions.
Quick look back at Blackpool's exit in Papa John’s Trophy on Wednesday
0-0 and losing 5-4 on pens, Robson missing the crucial spot kick.
Guest interview - Steve Day

 Why are you an Oxford fan?

 How long have you been going for?

 First - last - best - worst

 
    Match

      Manager

      Stadium

    
  

About Oxford United

  Oxford currently sit in 21st position in league one, P15 W4 D3 L8 and on 15 points.   *show table*

  So Steve, given you were league one promotion favorites, are you disappointed with your start to the season?

  Would you say you’re in a false position?

  Current form of P6 W1 D3 L2 - but if we look over the games, you have credible draws against the better teams in the league.  *show form*

  How do you rate your current squad compared last season?

  Can you see Oxford putting a run together and climbing the table and were do you expect to finish at the end of the season?

  Your thoughts on Blackpool youth reject manager, Kal Robinson?  For the Ox he has a win rate of 38.5%, games played P143 W55 D42 L46

  What style of football can Blackpool fans expect to see from Oxford and what are your strengths and weaknesses?

  Who do you see as Oxfords key players and danger men

    
      *Show squad*

      Cameron Branagan - Ex Liverpool acadamey, someone Critch will know well

      Matty Taylor - Striker and local boy

      James Henry - consistently bangs them in

    
  

Head to head

  Blackpool won 15, drawn 7, lost 11

  Last seasons matches, both 2-1

    
      At Bloomers *show stats* - Ryan Edwards' header and Armand Gnanduillet's penalty won it for the Seasiders, while Josh Ruffels struck for Oxford before half-time.

    
  
  Any memorable matches - to both


They played for both

  Daniel Agyei

  Gary Briggs

  Ben Woodburn

  Gnando

  Listeners give more


Prize draw

  Art of Football comp


Match predictions

  How do we all think tomorrow game is going to pan out

			<title><![CDATA[#166 - The lowdown on CJ Hamilton]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>It’s Thursday 23rd July</strong> and in this show I’m speaking to <strong>Craig Priest</strong> from the Mansfield Town fans podcast “<strong>Mansfield Matters</strong>” about Blackpool’s new signing CJ Hamilton and few bits about the mutual connections between us and the Stags</p>
<h2>About Craig, Mansfield Town and Mansfield Matters</h2>
<ul>
 <li>Craig, tell us about your podcast and a bit about yourself.<br>
</li>
 <li>So you finished in 21st place in League two on 38 points, I guess you’ve had better seasons?<br>
</li>
 <li>You dropped out of the league after the 07-08 season and spent SIX seasons in the conference eventually returning to the football league after winning the title in 2012-13. &nbsp;What was it like playing in the conference and how tough a league is it to get out of?<br>
</li>
 <li>Notable ex players who’ve played for both include Gordon Owen, Neal Bishop and the most well known is probably Alex Baptiste.<br>
</li>
 <li>Baps played for you between 2002-2008 with 198 appearances in all competitions, so, is he a bit of a club legend considering he was also a local boy done-good, all the way to the Premier League?<br>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Blackpool have signed winger CJ Hamilton from Mansfield Town on a three-year deal for an undisclosed fee.</strong></p>
<p>The 25-year-old scored three goals in 41 games for the Stags in all competitions last season.</p>
<p>He began his career at Sheffield United but left without playing a game and joined Mansfield in 2016 before going on to make 173 appearances.</p>
<p>---</p>
<ul>
 <li>What was your initial reaction when you first found out he had been sold?<br>
</li>
 <li>Could you elaborate on his best position and what can we expect from him?<br>
</li>
 <li>How integral was he to your squad and how much will he be missed?<br>
</li>
  <li>Will you be sad to see him go?<br>
</li>
  <li>What is his temperament like?<br>
</li>
  <li>How do you think he’ll fit in under Neil Critchley's system at Blackpool playing ‘The Liverpool way’?<br>
</li>
  <li>How do you think he will get on at Blackpool?<br>
</li>
  <li>Do you think he has the potential to play at the higher grade?<br>
</li>
</ul>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I’m speaking to <strong>Rich Pullen</strong> from the Swindon Town podcast “<strong>The Loathed Stranger</strong>” who’s going to give us the low-down and what to expect out of Blackpool’s new signing Keshi Anderson</p>
<ul>
 <li>First off, congratulations on your promotion and league title and we’ll be seeing you next season!</li>
 <li>Tell us about the name of your pod, whats the story?</li>
 <li>How does it feel to get promoted on these terms and does it take the gloss off it considering you’ve been top for five months?!</li>
 <li>I believe you are having a virtual open bus tour to celebrate?</li>
  <li>You are managed by former Blackpool midfield maestro, Richie Wellens? &nbsp;Obviouslly its a very successful brand of football but what style is it?</li>
  <li>How do you think you’ll do next season and which players</li>
</ul>
<p>Now onto <strong>Keshi Anderson</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Described as an “exciting, attack-minded player” - could elaborate on his best position and what can we expect from him?</li>
  <li>Hes played exactly 100 games scoring 15 goals, so not an out and out striker then?</li>
  <li>Was he an integral part of your side last season and will he be missed?</li>
  <li>How do you think he’ll fit in under Neil Critchley at Blackpool? &nbsp;‘The Liverpool way’.</li>
  <li>Do you think he has the ability to player at the upper leves of the football pyramid?</li>
  <li>Says on Wiki that Anderson declined the new contract offer and took to social media to announce that he was leaving the club upon the expiry of his contract. &nbsp;How did that go down?</li>
  <li>Finally, Richie Wellens has been quoted today saying that another club has bid for Jerry Yates and its rumoured to be us. &nbsp;14 goals in 31 appearances for you is a decent return.</li>
  <li>Can you tell us a bit about him?</li>

			<description><![CDATA[Club statement on season ticket/ticket refunds



The stark reality is that if every season ticket holder and seasonal corporate were to take up the option of a refund, then the ultimate financial cost to the Club could be in excess of £325,000.



Despite the lack of any visibility regarding next season, as you have seen from the recent announcements, the Club has continued to press ahead with implementing its plans for a bright, tangerine future. Over the forthcoming weeks, the Club will continue to invest towards its long term aim of improving the Club’s infrastructure and its more immediate target of promotion to the Championship.



In terms of compensating supporters, the Club is proposing the following options:



Season ticket holders can leave the cost of the 2019/20 season ticket in the Club, which will greatly help mitigate the costs of the Covid-19 pandemic and support plans for the 2020/21 promotion push by emailing option1@blackpoolfc.co.ukSupporters can donate the five tickets connected to the cancelled matches to the NHS, Emergency Service Personnel and Key Workers to say thank you by emailing option2@blackpoolfc.co.ukSupporters can also donate the five tickets connected to the cancelled matches for initiatives in local schools, football clubs and youth groups to generate an even better atmosphere in Bloomfield Road and to develop the next generation of Seasiders by emailing option3@blackpoolfc.co.ukA pro-rata credit towards a 2020/21 Season Ticket by emailing option4@blackpoolfc.co.ukA pro-rata refund for the cancelled home league games by emailing option5@blackpoolfc.co.uk

			<description><![CDATA[Its Sunday 17th May 2020, in today&#8217;s lockdown special show we virtually discuss the future of the leagues in England and how well Blackpool might be positioned to weather COVID-19 storm, we reflect on 2010 Wembley play-off final against Cardiff as unbelievably, the tenth anniversary of the match is this coming Friday&#8230; unt ze Bundesliga is back, yah?



1 &#8211; The future of the leagues



In a nutshell, the situation at present:



The National League decided to end its three divisions immediately on 22 April but was waiting on the EFL to announce an outcome before deciding on promotion and relegation.League Two&#8217;s season has been brought to an early conclusion following discussions between clubs and the English Football League on Friday (14th May).Although it is understood some League Two sides wanted to use a weighted points-per-game system to finalise the table, the EFL has confirmed an unweighted points-per-game system was agreed upon.Both of those methods would have seen Stevenage stay bottom &#8211; yet clubs have also requested that relegation from the fourth tier is removed this season.&#8220;Clubs asked for consideration to be given to suspending relegation to the National League for 2019-20 as a result of circumstances created where fixtures cannot be completed,&#8221; said the EFL in a statement.&#8220;No commitments were made in this respect and the board will now consider the implications of the division&#8217;s preferred approach at their next meeting.&#8221;Any move still needs to be ratified by the EFL and Football Association.But League One sides face further talks after failing to come to an agreement.Six third-tier clubs had said prior to the meeting that they were determined to complete their remaining fixtures &#8211; and are now set to meet again on Monday in an attempt to find a resolution.



Talking points



So from the above, it seems like the clubs are leading the decision making process, which seems a bit weird to me.&nbsp; Surely decisions need to be made by the governing bodies?Read Richard Watt



2 &#8211; Blackpool FC is facing severe financial losses as a result of football’s shutdown but is well-placed to come through the crisis.



That’s the view of chief executive Ben Mansford, who says the club is most fortunate to have the backing of owner Simon Sadler.



However, he said the severity of the situation could force clubs out of business.



Bloomfield Road has not opened its doors to spectators since March 10.



The club still has nine outstanding fixtures in a League One season scheduled to end a fortnight ago – five of those games at home.



Asked how that loss of match income was affecting the club, Mansford said: “Clubs in the EFL are certainly more dependent on matchday revenue, especially in League One and League Two.



“We lost probably our most lucrative game of the season against Sunderland 24 hours before it was due to take place (on March 14).



“Also, the club were particularly affected by games against local teams that were scheduled for Saturdays being rearranged for midweek.



“All clubs are really struggling without that income and it does create a big financial hole.



“That lack of income is a real problem for football clubs and businesses in general right now.



“The true nature of the impact will be more definable when we know more about when and how football will return in League One.”



However, Mansford believes the backing of Blackpool-born businessman Sadler will spare the Seasiders the “dire consequences” possibly facing some clubs.



He added: “We are very fortunate to have a very supportive owner in Simon Sadler, although the magnitude of loss that the club is facing is severe.



“We will face some tough decisions, like all clubs and businesses, but some clubs could face dire consequences and potentially go out of business.



“We believe we are in a good position to come through this period in a stable state.”

GTF scroing at Old Trafford



2010 Championship play-off final&nbsp;



What was the journey down to London like?&nbsp; Did you stay in a nice hotel or was it a cheap and nasty B&amp;B?!Pre match atmoshpere in the dressing room and what was Ian Holloways team talk like?What was it to like to walk and see that wall of tangerine &#8211; and play at 106f1st HALFTalk us through the first half and what it was like to play in.&nbsp;Chopra (wanker just goaded our fans when he scored)Adam&nbsp;Ledley&nbsp;GTF &#8211; (hit the post just before the corner as well)&nbsp;Brett2nd HALFOnly things I remember were Chopra hitting the post and BBB running in treacle when clean through&nbsp;You got injured, what was the injuryEmotions at full time and was the mood and Ollie like in the dressing room after the game.Did any of the Oystons come the dressing room?What did you all do after the match?

Build up



First season in the top flight since 1971&nbsp;The bonus debacle in the run up to the start of the seasonThe none payment of Charlie’s survival bonus and subsquent court case.&nbsp;&nbsp;How did the two above events affect the dressing room morale?What were your thoughts on the none signing of Dobbie and DJ even though, DJ eventually signed four games in.Thoughts on the extremley late business in the transfer market. Incredibly, 81 days had passed until we made our first signing since winning the play off final.&nbsp; Do you think the squad was suitably reinforced for survival in the PL?



Season

			<title><![CDATA[#156 – Not a virus more]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[It’s Wednesday the 1st April, in todays show we review Neil Critchleys first two games in charge with the nil-nil draw at Fleetwood and one-two home reverse to Tranmere.  We also perform a &#8220;keep or dump&#8221; review of all the potentially outgoing players at the end of the season,  debate and decide the two centre forward berths as we conculde the team for the worst ever eleven and we muse over what we&#8217;re all missing about not be able to go to &#8216;Pool matches cause of this bloody virus.  



Last match reviews



Fleetwood 0 &#8211; Blackpool 0&nbsp;







Neil Critchley&#8217;s reign as Blackpool manager began with a goalless draw away to Fylde coast neighbours Fleetwood, whose unbeaten run extended to 11 games.



Blackpool dominated the first period and Matty Virtue twice went close in the early stages, seeing an effort well saved by Alex Cairns and then driving a shot just off target.&nbsp; Fleetwood improved after the restart and Paddy Madden headed Lewie Coyle&#8217;s smart cross narrowly wide.



Fans comments



Tony Fretwell17 &#8211; Matty VirtueBut of a non event given the hype. Sat in the main stand with Cods I was taken at all the petty nasty comments about Blackpool. Bit embarrassing from them really. On the pitch was promising from us but ultimately no real threat on their goal. But defending seems to have definitely improvedBrian32 &#8211; Chris Maxwell.Lee McLeod42 &#8211; Taylor MooreA great taste of what&#8217;s to come, pressing, chasing down opposition and a general work hard philosophy. 2nd half ran out of steam but it will come. Draw fair result.Sam freedman17 &#8211; Matty VirtueReally impressed in the first half on how we controlled the game, virtue stepped up and took the lead in the middle And dictating play . we were toothless up top, delfonso is just NOT A striker. by half time fleetwood saw that we couldn’t score and came back in the second half and a draw was probably a fair result, on a side note happy to see turton left out we looked much better at the back with 3 centre backs.Mark MacKay42 &#8211; Taylor MooreAs a recent podcast listener, apologies, I made the point to Tim pre-match that I couldn’t believe neither Andy Welsh nor David Ferguson got mentioned in the worst XI



Blackpool 1 &#8211; Tranmere 2







Ferrier headed neatly into the corner as he rose to meet Calum Woods&#8217; cross on 37 mins. In added time, James Vaughan side-footed home from 15 yards after meeting Ferrier&#8217;s pass.



Blackpool halved the deficit just before the hour mark when Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall smashed home from 25 yards. Within a minute it was almost 2-2, but Davies palmed Ronan&#8217;s shot from even further out onto the post.



Liam Feeney missed two good chances to equalise for Blackpool late on.



Fans Comments



Tony Fretwell35 &#8211; Keiran Dewsbury-HallI’ll be honest, I know there was lots of complaining we lost but the second half was as entertaining and exciting as any part of the season to date. Really bodes well for meLee McLeod35 &#8211; Keiran Dewsbury-HallFirst half we allowed ourselves to be bullied by their front two. 2nd half was probably the best half I&#8217;ve seen in some time. Our 2 young midfielders are running the show and the quality oozes from Ronan and KDH.Mark Mackay40 &#8211; Connor RonanI’m concerned that 4 of our starting XI are loans you’d have to assume will return to their parent clubs on season completion. Elicit debate…



Keep or Dump



We go through the list of players who are potenitally leaving at the end of the season due to their contracts or loan deals expiring,&nbsp;











Worst ever XI&nbsp;



As we close out this section, we finally decide on the worst eleven Blackpool XI as we pick the worst ever two strikers from our shortlist of ten.

			<description><![CDATA[It’s Monday the 2nd March 2020.&nbsp; In today&#8217;s show we are joined by Josh Sexton from the Anfield Wrap (a Liverpool fans podcast) who is going to give us the low-down on Neil Critchley, as Blackpool appoint the Liverpool U23 manager as their new ‘head coach’.&nbsp; We also review Saturday’s dramatic two-one victory over Ipswich at Bloomfield Road and we draw up the shortlist for the two centre-forward berths in the ‘Worst Ever 11’.



Neil Critchley is the new Blackpool ‘head coach’



We are joined on the line by Josh Sexton who covers the Liverpool acadmey side for the Anfield Wrap.







Questions from the fans:



Graham Clayton &#8211; Aside from player development, how do you think Neil will adapt to the pressures of needing results on the pitch week-in-week-out?Tommy Wilson &#8211; Which academy players could he realistically see being loaned to us next season?John Ford &#8211; Not to do with BFC, but I&#8217;d like to know his view on Harry Wilson. Does he think he has a future at LFCJohn Ford &#8211; The Seasiders Podcast has just done a &#8220;worst 11&#8221; feature. I&#8217;ve seen a similar feature on LFC recently and Pool legends Paul Stewart and Charlie Adam were mentioned! What&#8217;s their view on these 2 ex BFC players?Al Rayyis &#8211; What is Critchley&#8217;s preferred formation and style of play? Is it based on Klopp&#8217;s philosophy or do you think he will implement his own style at Blackpool?Colin MCGilbert &#8211; NC is a ‘nice guy’ so does he need a ‘bad cop’ on the staff?



From us:



Do you think its a big step up from U23 management and do you think he’ll be a success at Blackpool



Interview with NC on You Tube

Blackpool 2 &#8211; Ipswich 1







A report of our day in the box courtesy of Tim and his solicitors firm Barker, Booth and Eastwood.Met the ref in the foyer before!The random Hong Kong looking guy taking picures on the balcony.Bloomfield Bear coming in the boxMeeting and interviewing Tony Green afterwards and Danny Coid also.Great goal from KDH to put us one upMadine missed another sitter in the first halfSoft equaliser for Ipswich, poor defending from ‘Pool, their goal had a feeling of inevitability about itA string of great saves from Maxwell in both halvesDunn booed for not bringing Madine off, not for bringing Nuttall on to replace Ronan.Absolute scenes when Joe Nuttall bagged the winner!

Is it based on Klopp&amp;#8217;s philosophy or do you think he will implement his own style at Blackpool?Colin MCGilbert &amp;#8211; NC is a ‘nice guy’ so does he need a ‘bad cop’ on the staff?



From us:



Do you think its a big step up from U23 management and do you think he’ll be a success at Blackpool



Interview with NC on You Tube









Last match reviews



Blackpool 2 &amp;#8211; Ipswich 1







A report of our day in the box courtesy of Tim and his solicitors firm Barker, Booth and Eastwood.Met the ref in the foyer before!The random Hong Kong looking guy taking picures on the balcony.Bloomfield Bear coming in the boxMeeting and interviewing Tony Green afterwards and Danny Coid also.Great goal from KDH to put us one upMadine missed another sitter in the first halfSoft equaliser for Ipswich, poor defending from ‘Pool, their goal had a feeling of inevitability about itA string of great saves from Maxwell in both halvesDunn booed for not bringing Madine off, not for bringing Nuttall on to replace Ronan.Absolute scenes when Joe Nuttall bagged the winner!
